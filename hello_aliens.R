cat("Before I  introduce Earth, I was wondering which planet or galaxy you have arrived from and whether or not you have
a written language where you are from. Here on Earth, we often speculate that alien life forms will visit us from any of 
the nine planets within our galaxy. We have many different plants, animals, humans, and other forms of living things 
on our planet. Some of the biggest cities you can visit include Tokyo, Shanghai, New Delhi, and New York, but there are 
many other exciting places to see during your stay on Earth across our seven continents. Is the planet you have arrived from
larger or smaller than ours? I am sure many of us on Earth would like to visit your planet! We have sent humans to the moon
and  the International Space Station, but we are looking forward to exploring other parts of our universe as well.")
